### Hi there 👋

I'm Fi, a content designer / UX writer / I did a bit of content writing and in a past life marketing 💻🍲🥡
I'd like to learn more about coding so I can help to create things, and hopefully teach ladies, because I would have loved to have found an IT mentor too earlier.
Coding takes some work - and I'm trying to put in the time and do a learning journal too :) 

I have a passion for words and technology

My current side project is learning Python so I can experiment with AI language models
